# RubyGems - Work in Progress

This is a [code along](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-6-learn-20-gems-build-an-e-learning-platform) by [Yaroslav Shmarov](https://github.com/yshmarov) to build a e-learning platform.

It includes several gems I've used on other projects that I wanted to understand better.

[Try the Demo!](https://laurie-rubygems.herokuapp.com/ ) It's hosted on Heroku so it might take a few seconds to spin up.

Rails 6.1.3.1 | 
ruby 2.7.2 | 
PG | 
BS 4.6 | 

Gems Used:
Action Text / Trix
Haml-rails

This is my first project using HAML.
